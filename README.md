# Algo_Vision Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

**Algo Vision** is an interactive web application designed to visualize and understand various sorting algorithms. It provides a dynamic and educational experience for users to explore how algorithms work, step-by-step, with real-time comparisons, swaps, and timing statistics.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Supports visualization of:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Adjust the speed of sorting animations.
  - Modify the size of the array being sorted.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**:
  - Bars representing array elements with visual cues for comparing, swapping, and sorted states.
  - Real-time statistics for comparisons, swaps, and elapsed time.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and modern browsers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd algo-vision
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### Usage

1. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Adjust the **Speed** and **Array Size** sliders as needed.
3. Click **Generate New Array** to create a randomized dataset.
